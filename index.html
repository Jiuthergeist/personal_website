				Hi there! I'm a recent graduate from UC Berkeley majored in both computer science and statistics (data science, anyone?). While I'll tell you that I'm from San Jose (well, I was born there at least), I mostly grew up in Shanghai, China where I studied in an international school called <a href="http://www.smicschool.com/" class="text-link" target="_blank">The SMIC Private School</a> (Don't ask what SMIC stands for. <a href="#" class="read-more text-link">You'll be confused...</a><span class="more-text"> SMIC = Super Mario is Cool = Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation. Yep.</span>). Now, I'm excited to be back in the Bay Area, the perfect place to be as an aspiring computer scientist, and I'm eager to start my first full-time opportunity!

				Finishing my undergraduate degree at Cal, I have covered a large breadth of disciplines in both computer science and statistics. Besides core ideas covered in algorithms, operating systems, and databases, I've also had a chance to learn things about machine learning and natural language processing. Now, with the theoretical knowledge down, I'm eager to apply all this knowledge to develop meaningful software and extract interesting patterns from data to produce useful solutions for our problems today.

				As relaxing as chilling for a whole summer sounds, it's also a perfect opportunity to apply what I learned in school to real-world problems through internships. I've had the opportunity to work in both software engineering and data analytics positions, and during my senior year I also tacked on some research in one of UC Berkeley's labs. Now I'm ready to tackle my first opportunity full-time!

							Position: Undergraduate Researcher for (Ray) Tune, Formerly for Modin<br>
							<a href="https://www.opentable.com" class="text-link" target="_blank">RISELab</a> is a UC Berkeley lab focusing on Real-time Intelligent Secure Explainable systems (how the name came to be!). I started out in <a href="https://github.com/modin-project/modin" class="text-link" target="_blank">Modin</a>, a framework designed to parallelize Pandas to handle big data much more efficiently. I only spent two months with this project, but I was able to add support for reading in JSON files that have a two-times speedup on any file 200 MB or larger. I then moved on to <a href="https://docs.ray.io/en/master/tune.html" class="text-link" target="_blank">Ray Tune</a> (or just Tune for short), where I did two larger scale projects: <br><br>
							<ol>
								<li>Adding support for a Bayesian optimization library <a href="https://github.com/dragonfly/dragonfly" class="text-link" target="_blank">Dragonfly</a> within Tune. This involved exposing a new API for Dragonfly itself -- an ask-tell interface to iteratively retrieve and feed in data points -- to integrate this into Tune. More documentation <a href="https://dragonfly-opt.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting_started_ask_tell/" class="text-link" target="_blank">here</a> for the curious!</li>
								<li>Creating <a href="https://github.com/ray-project/tune-sklearn" class="text-link" target="_blank">tune-sklearn</a>: a grid search cross validation interface similar to scikit-learn's <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html" class="text-link" target="_blank">GridSearchCV</a>, but with improved back-end from Tune to add parallelism and early stopping mechanisms to speed up hyperparameter tuning. This project is able to achieve up to 10 times the speed of scikit-learn, and is also able to beat similar libraries like Dask which takes at least double the time of Tune's. Check out the <a href="https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/gridsearchcv-2-0-new-and-improved-ee56644cbabf" class="text-link" target="_blank">Medium article</a> featuring the new library!</li>

							Position: Back-End Engineer Intern (Promoted Inventory Team)<br>
							<a href="https://www.opentable.com" class="text-link" target="_blank">OpenTable</a> is one among many companies within <a href="https://www.opentable.com" class="text-link" target="_blank">Booking Holdings</a>. OpenTable allows consumers to easily make reservations at restaurants, but more importantly gives restaurants tools to manage customer flow and create campaigns to optimize restaurant business. As a back-end engineer intern on the promoted inventory team, I directly influenced ways for restaurants to promote themselves. Most notably, I worked on a referral code service, where I was able to start (<i>from <b>scratch!</b></i>) a way for users to refer others to restaurants and enabling both parties to get rewards and badges for successful referrals. Since I kickstarted the project, I was able to interact with many components of the back-end, including continuous integration, the database (PostgreSQL), referral code generation, and handling streams of events. This internship has given me a much better view of Java and agile development in industry and was an excellent summer to supplement my academic education!

				I'm not an intense gamer, but I do play Clash Royale daily (still after almost four years!). I currently hit 6600 trophies consistently, up in the "royal champion" leagues where the top few percent of players compete. I have a personal best of 6898 trophies, and I managed to end the May 2020 season at rank #6924! But my best ranking at any given point in time is #1663 midway into the April 2019 season, and some day I hope to beat that! I'm also currently an active <a href="https://twitch.tv/lemonayyde" class="text-link" target="_blank">Twitch streamer</a> where I share my Clash Royale gameplay at least twice a week along with other casual games from time to time, so if looking at my <a href="http://statsroyale.com/profile/JUJL09JU" class="text-link" target="_blank">Clash Royale profile</a> isn't enough for you, come say hi on my stream!
				<br><br>
				I also used to play some chess (haters will call this nerdy), competing in tournaments and brushing up on tactics. I tried my hand again at chess in February 2020 for a team tournament, but if I want to be the next Magnus Carlsen, looks like I have <a href="http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?16074170" class="text-link" target="_blank">a lot more to go...</a>
				<br><br>
				Musically, I've been a drummer since middle school, and I even played in a rock band for a couple years in high school. Sadly, having a drumset in my apartment here would annoy my roommates and neighbors, so all I can do now is (sort of) beatbox or get lit through <a href="http://www.virtualdrumming.com/" class="text-link" target="_blank">virtual drums</a>.
				<br><br>
				Other random things I enjoy are playing basketball and laying in bed for an extra multiple of 9 minutes before the alarm goes off again (that's how my snooze works apparently). Oh, and Mickey Mouse is great. If you haven't figured it out from the background. Just making sure. :)

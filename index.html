				Hi there! I'm a rising junior at UC Berkeley majoring in both computer science and statistics (I'm strongly considering data science as a major now that it's becoming official here). While I'll tell you that I'm from San Jose (Well, I was born there at least), I mostly grew up in Shanghai, China where I studied in an international school called <a href="http://www.smicschool.com/" class="text-link" target="_blank">The SMIC Private School</a> (Don't ask what SMIC stands for. <a href="#" class="read-more text-link">You'll be confused...</a><span class="more-text"> SMIC = Super Mario is Cool = Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation. Yep.</span>). Now, I'm excited to be back in the Bay Area, the perfect place to be as an aspiring computer scientist!

				As a rising junior, I'm starting to get my hands dirty with upper division computer science and statistics. I'll be continuing to gain more theoretical knowledge in these fields as I continue to work on other side projects to garner some practical experience. I'm eager to apply all this knowledge to develop meaningful software and extract interesting patterns from data to produce useful solutions for our problems today.

				School is great and all, but what about other skills? Well, obviously I have some basics down for web development, since you're looking at a result of it right now! I'm still working on expanding my technical skills, but here's what I got down so far:

							Inspired by our success with Megafind, we took our web app to the next level and made a new version to be used in some of Berkeley's computer science classes! This version is more tuned towards video lectures captured live or pre-recorded, providing a view of the video, a transcript, and a Q&A pane all in one dashboard. Instructors can also insert small exercises to allow viewers check their understanding while watching the lecture!

						I'm not an intense gamer, but I do play Clash Royale daily (still!). I had been consistently ending seasons with 4900+ trophies, up in the "master" leagues where around the top 100,000 players (or fewer) compete before they introduced the new season reset that inflates your trophies month after month. Now I have a personal best of 5507 trophies, and I even got myself ranked #4042 midway into the season in early July! I also used to play some chess (haters will call this nerdy), competing in tournaments and brushing up on tactics. If Facebook stalking (if you can find me by my not-so-unique name) isn't enough for you, go ahead and check my <a href="http://statsroyale.com/profile/JUJL09JU" class="text-link" target="_blank">Clash Royale</a> and <a href="http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?16074170" class="text-link" target="_blank">chess</a> profiles.

						Musically, I've been a drummer since middle school, and I even played in a rock band for a couple years in high school. Sadly, having a drumset in my apartment here would annoy my roommates and neighbors, so all I can do now is (sort of) beatbox or get lit through <a href="http://www.virtualdrumming.com/" class="text-link" target="_blank">virtual drums</a>.
						<br><br>
						Other random things I enjoy are playing basketball and laying in bed for precisely 9 minutes before the alarm goes off again (that's how my snooze works apparently). Oh, and Mickey Mouse is great. If you haven't figured it out from the background. Just making sure. :)
